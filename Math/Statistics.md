# What's the deal with data?

As humans, our insatiable desire to `learn`, make `inferences` about things, and `predict future events` requires knowledge about the world. 

This is where **data** comes in. **Data** is information you collect in order to learn, make conclusions, and perform experiments to answer questions you have. For example:

``` Say I want to know what the gender wage gap is in the US. I could collect the following data from a large amount of men and women working at companies: age, hourly/monthly/annual salary, years spent at company, education, etc. I could then plot this data to look for trends. Below is a histogram looking at age and monthly salary, categorized by gender```

## **Types of data**

 The term `feature` is often used synonomously with `variable` and `attribute`. They all mean the same thing: some kind of measurement attained from a 

# Population vs Sample space

## **Population**

A **population** is an *entire* collection of people, objects, or other things of interest that you want to record meaningful **features** from. 
However, we often *do not* have access to *the entire population* of whatever we're measuring. For example:

```Imagine I want to predict an American high school student's GPA given certain features like hours studied, test grades, number of classes skipped, etc. In this case, the population is every single high school student in the US, which is over ten million. Interviewing every student here, however, is not plausible. There are too many students, and I don't have time for that!```

Instead, I

# Measures of Central Tendency

## **Mean**
- Denotes the `average` number of an array. It's a "central value" caluclated by `dividing` the sum of the values `by` by the total \# of values
- There are two types of means in statistics:
	1. **Population (true) mean** - the mean of all values in a target population. We don't often can't acquire  the **true** mean because that would require us to have access to `every single value from the population`, which is rarely the case.

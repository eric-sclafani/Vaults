# What's the deal with data?

As humans, our insatiable desire to `learn`, make `inferences` about things, and `predict future events` requires **knowledge** about the world. This knowledge is where **data** comes in.

**Data** is the information that enables you to do all of those things mentioned above. For example:

``` Say I want to learn what the gender wage gap is in the US. I could collect the following data from a large amount of people working at companies: gender, age, hourly/monthly/annual salary, years spent at company, education, etc. I could then plot this data to look for trends. I could also try to predict someone's salary based off this data.```

Below is a histogram I found looking at age and monthly salary, categorized by gender. Can you notice certain patterns from this data?

## **Types of data**

 When you collect data from a source, you are attaining distinct characteristics that define the group you are measuring from. These characteristics are called `variables`. This term is used synonomously with `feature` and `attribute`. In the example above, `gender, age, salary, etc...` would all be different variables. 
 
However, not all data is the same. Data can have varying properties that 

# Population vs Sample 

## **Population**

A **population** is an *entire* collection of people, objects, or other things of interest that you want to record meaningful **features** from. 
However, we often *do not* have access to *the entire population* of whatever we're measuring. For example:

```Imagine I want to predict an American high school student's GPA given certain features like hours studied, test grades, number of classes skipped, etc. In this case, the population is every single high school student in the US, which is over ten million. Interviewing every student here, however, is not plausible. There are too many students, and I don't have time for that!```

Instead, I

# Measures of Central Tendency

## **Mean**
- Denotes the `average` number of an array. It's a "central value" caluclated by `dividing` the sum of the values `by` by the total \# of values
- There are two types of means in statistics:
	1. **Population (true) mean** - the mean of all values in a target population. We don't often can't acquire  the **true** mean because that would require us to have access to `every single value from the population`, which is rarely the case.
